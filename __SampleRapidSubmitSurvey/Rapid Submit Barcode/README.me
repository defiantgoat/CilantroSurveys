# RapidSubmit Barcode Scanning Surveys

This is a sample form that will work with the CilantroSurveys rapid submit functionality.
The survey can currently only contain one question, which should be a barcode type input.

For these surveys to work, the following line of code must be in the form's .info file:

"rapidSubmit": true
